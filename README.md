# TruckPost

This is a help post website for truck drivers that drive on long routes all over the nation.

They sometimes face unusual problems when they visit other states,
so here we created a unified place for all the drivers to post,
info about different states.

-The user has to be a member.

-To be a member he can simply register, using email address and a 7 letter password.

-If a new user, he has to complete his profile and give some basic information,
about himself.

-When a member of truckpost, the user will have 2 options

1- Where he can make a post about any state.

2- View posts for any states made by all the members.

3- Log out button can be used to log out.

4- Home takes you to the two options from any page.

5- Admin has all the rights to delete or update a post.

Completion of requirements.

1. The MVC pattern is used to seprate all database logics. Classes in the classes folder,
    pages in the views folder, and validation and requirements in the model folder.

2. Fat-Free framework was used to route in the index file.

3. The PDO layer usage is correctly definer in model folder, dbconnections.php file,
    which uses PDO and prepared statements for all the function which are used to interact
    the database.
4. Data can be viewed when user clicks on view posts and selects a state in website.(from home page)
    Data can be added when user clicks on make post in website. (from home page)
    Data can be updated i.e posts made by the users/members, can be updated by the admin at any moment for any state. (Admin login).
    Data can be deleted i.e posts made by the users can be deleted anytime by the adming.

5. Regular commits were done by both the partners after updating or changing the code, many pair progrmas were also done,
    considering equal and unified contribution to the project.

6. Uses OOPS, uses 3 classes, which extends from one another as described by the UML class 
    diagram.

7.  All the php files have Docblocks and additional comments wherever necessary.

8. Full validation for each and every field has been made where ever the user is trying to enter some data using java script.
    On almost all the pages. All the files in the script folder.

9. jQuery is used on almost every html file.
    Ajax is used for admin login to delete and update the data, using two files from model directory
    named delete and update.php
